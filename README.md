# TaskCenter

The C# project is a user-friendly software for task management across multiple boards. It follows a three-layered pattern, separating presentation, business logic, and data access. This approach ensures a modular design, code reusability, and efficient collaboration. Users can register, create boards, add tasks, and enjoy features like due dates and notifications. The software promotes effective task management and boosts productivity.
